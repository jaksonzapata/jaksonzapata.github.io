                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>Developed a LeetCode clone platform that allows users to solve algorithmic coding problems in a
                    browser-based code editor. The application replicates core features of LeetCode, including problem
                    browsing, code execution, and solution submission.</p>
                <p>Implemented an interactive code editor with syntax highlighting and multiple language support. Users
                    can write, test, and submit their solutions directly in the browser. The platform includes a
                    comprehensive problem library with varying difficulty levels and categories.</p>
                <p>Built with Next.js and React to provide a seamless single-page application experience. The project
                    features real-time code validation, test case execution, and immediate feedback on solution
                    correctness. The responsive design ensures optimal usability across desktop and mobile devices.</p>
                <p>Integrated features such as problem filtering by difficulty and topic, code templates for different
                    programming languages, and a clean, user-friendly interface that mimics the professional coding
                    platform experience.</p>
